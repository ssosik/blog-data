Information retrieval is a wide, often loosely-defined term but in these pages I
shall be concerned only with automatic information retrieval systems. Automatic
as opposed to manual and information as opposed to data or fact. Unfortunately
the word information can be very misleading. In the context of information
retrieval (IR), information, in the technical meaning given in Shannon's theory
of communication, is not readily measured (Shannon and Weaver[1]). In fact, in
many cases one can adequately describe the kind of retrieval by simply
substituting 'document' for 'information'. Nevertheless, 'information retrieval'
has become accepted as a description of the kind of work published by Cleverdon,
Salton, Sparck Jones, Lancaster and others. A perfectly straightforward
definition along these lines is given by Lancaster[2]: 'Information retrieval is
the term conventionally, though somewhat inaccurately, applied to the type of
activity discussed in this volume. An information retrieval system does not
inform (i.e. change the knowledge of) the user on the subject of his inquiry. It
merely informs on the existence (or non-existence) and whereabouts of documents
relating to his request.' This specifically excludes Question-Answering systems
as typified by Winograd[3] and those described by Minsky[4]]. It also excludes
data retrieval systems such as used by, say, the stock exchange for on-line
quotations.
