Leverage the concepts from CDN technology:

-   DDOS
-   Monster hits
-   breaking news
-   botnets
-   script-kiddies
-   caching and cache heirarchy
-   cloud services
-   click conversions
-   security vulnerabilities
-   hacker states
-   black/gray/white hats
-   natural disasters
-   network outages
-   databases
-   firewalls
-   high availability
-   runaway customers
-   rogue customers
-   software updates
-   data breaches

General idea is that the player builds out a CDN network and needs to
serve content to viable customers while defending against attackers and
service outages. Primary source of conflict is the balance between
serving content while taking minimal damage.

Initial thoughts on how to visualize this would be a Turtle in the
center of the screen
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles\_all\_the\_way\_down), and the
player builds infrastructure around the turtle. The point of the game is
to let customers get to the turtle while preventing attackers from doing
so.

Around the edge of the screen would be a globe dial showing transitions
from day to night and back again. During the day, customers are "good";
during the night they transition to attackers. During a given wave, the
globe dial would rotate.
